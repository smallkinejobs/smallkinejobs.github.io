## What Kine Jobs? Small Kine Jobs!

### Description
The purpose of this project is to learn software engineering skills. Skills such as team-based collaboration, becoming better at learning different UI frameworks such as Semantic and React, and developing locally run apps.

### Service provided by application
The Small Kine Jobs app will be used to help students who would like to find short term employment. Reasons for needing short term employment could be: The student is only at the University for a year or less, a student needing quick cash, or even if an employer needs an employee for a short period of time. This app would provide a quick and easy outlet to find an employer/employee without having to go to a temporary job agency, which can sometimes have long replying periods or sometimes too many applicants. 
Most importantly the app is specific for UH students, who already have the financial burden of funding their education.
