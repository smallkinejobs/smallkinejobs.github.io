## Small Kine Description
The Small Kine Jobs app will be used to help students who would like to find short term employment. Reasons for needing short term employment could be: The student is only at the University for a year or less, a student needing quick cash, or even if an employer needs an employee for a short period of time. This app would provide a quick and easy outlet to find an employer/employee without having to go to a temporary job agency, which can sometimes have long replying periods or sometimes too many applicants. 
Most importantly the app is specific for UH students, who already have the financial burden of funding their education.

## Community Feedback

### M2 Delpoyment
The initial launch of the app was small step in the right direction but not a success. Due to a bug within a portion of the code some users would receive an error message. The bug was determined to be from an error which needed an image, but there was no image to be found. But when the users didn’t get the bug, they found it easy to log in and sign up. They couldn’t really interact with other users, so we’ll start that in M3. But our landing pages and sign up pages did what they were supposed to do. Engage the user and have them use the website immediately. There should be a delete button for the job creation as well in case the job being posted isn’t correct. There also may need to be a filter for what jobs are legitimate or not as well, so that way spam can be avoided in job postings. The job postings can also be seen live as soon as they are posted by a user. 

### M3 Deployment
Coming Soon!
